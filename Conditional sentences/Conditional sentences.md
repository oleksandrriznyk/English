There are five types of conditional sentences in English:

**0-conditional:**

This type of conditional is used when we want to tell about something that is the general truth.

[*If clause*] **Present Simple** - [*Main clause*] **Present Simple**
*Example*: If it rains then the grass is wet.

**1-conditional:**

This type of conditional is used when we are talking about possible condition and its possible result.

[*If clause*] **Present Simple** - [*Main clause*] **Future Simple**
*Example*: If I see the spider in my house I will be very scared.
If this thing happens that thing will happen.

**2-conditional:**

This type of conditional is used when we are talking about a hypothetical condition and its probable result.

[*If clause*] **Past Simple** -  [*Main clause*]**Present conditional or Present continuous conditional**
*Example*: If I were the president I would increase people life rate.
If I were rich I would be living wherever I want.

**3-conditional**

This type of conditional is used when we want to tell about an unreal past condition and its probable result in the past.

[*If clause*] **Past Perfect** - [*Main clause*] **Perfect conditional**
*Example* If I had known about the interview earlier I would have prepared better (*But I had not known*)

**Mixed type**

This type of conditional combines 2nd and 3rd types of conditional sentences.
It is used to express an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present.

[*If clause*] **Past Perfect** - [*Main clause*] **Present conditional**
*Example* If I had worked harder I would live in the USA.
